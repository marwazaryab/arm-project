# ðŸŽ¯ 3D Printed Arm #
As a summer project, we decided to design an arm that can pick up cubes as a way to learn new engineering practices within design, wiring and controls! Here are our arms features:
- Three Degrees of Freedom.
- Diffrential Wrist with Pitch and Roll.
- Claw end effector to pick up cube objects.

# ðŸ’» Our CAD! #

Our arm was made using AutoCAD Inventor and went through many iterations to reach its final version.

# ðŸŽ€ Next Steps #
This project is still **in development!** We are currently working on our code base, which will include functionality to move the joints, as well as pick up cubes!
